# Woodberry_classification_Deep_NN 
A classification Deep NN model to predict different woodberries and scrap.

Purpose of the classification:<br>
Classification model to predict different woodberries to be used as support to berry pickers and in the process of cleancing (quallity assure) the pickers harvest.

Approach:<br>
Base the evaluation on a modified model from Deeplearning.ai in the Cousera course "Neural Networks and Deep Learning".<br>
One-hot Deep NN model implementation. 

Set-up:<br>
Modified model from Deeplearning.ai : "Tensorflow Tutorial v3"

Own image sets:
<ul>
<li>Train: A set of 1080 images of six sorts of woodberries and one set of scrap
<li>Test/dev set 1: A set of 300 images including the six sorts and scrap images
<li>test/dev set 2 : A second set of 300 images including the six sorts and scrap images.
</ul>
Note: Based on Andrew Ng's Deep Learning courses provided by Deeplearning.ai at Cousera. Thanks !
